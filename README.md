#Hey!

This is Drew and I'm learning new tricks! I'd rather be surfing than anything else 🏄, I love burritos 🌯, and am a total beer snob. I'm married to a total hottie who also happens to be brilliant - I'm a lucky dude!

We live in Oakland, CA and I'm job searching (and hate it!) but keeping a good attitude and open mind. I have a side project going, with a good friend, that I'm really excited about and may be tapping GitHub for thoughts & opinions at some point.
